# intro
This is the place where we are keeping our code, and tracking its changes over time

# Possible projects to include here:
- Neural coding in motor behavior in songbirds
- Population activity in retina cells
- Model reduction within parameter space
- Information bottleneck in deep structures
- Long time correlations in the behavior of flies
- Ancestral traits in fly behavior
- Estimation of entropy for long tail distributions
